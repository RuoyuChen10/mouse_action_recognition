Mouse action is important for drug analysis, which contribute to scientists to use the daily action of rats to conduct big data analysis. However, this is difficult for feature engineering due to complex scenes, so I want to through this project to understand the deep learning using for video analytics.

Requiring Environment:

- Pytorch 1.6.0
- numpy 1.18.1
- opencv-python 4.4.0.44
